# Password Generator App

A **simple, interactive password generator** built with HTML, CSS, and JavaScript. This project was created as part of my personal learning journey, inspired by Scrimba courses and their solo project exercises designed to help learners grow their web development skills.

## Features

- Generate **strong, random passwords** with configurable length
- Include/exclude **numbers** and **symbols**
- Two passwords generated at once for convenience
- Click a password to **copy it to the clipboard**
- Error handling for invalid password lengths

## How It Works

1. Enter the desired password length (default: 8)
2. Toggle **numbers** and **symbols** options
3. Click **Generate**
4. Copy passwords by double-clicking on them
5. Messages appear without breaking layout
